# Giftr

###Project Three

Giftr is General Assembly's WDI-ATL cohort 5's third project. Giftr is a full-stack application that was developed using Mongo, Express and Node.  The technical requirements of this team project included:

* Use Mongo & Express to build an API and a front-end that consumes it
* Create an API using at least 2 related models, one of which should be a user
* Include all major CRUD functions in a RESTful API for at least one of those models
* Consume your own API by making your front-end with HTML, Javascript, & jQuery
* Add authentication to your API to restrict access to appropriate users
* Craft thoughtful user stories together, as a team
* Manage team contributions and collaboration using a standard Git flow on Github
* Layout and style your front-end with clean & well-formatted CSS
* Deploy your application online so it's publically accessible

###Giftr Basics

Giftr is a gift generator application that provides the user with gift ideas based on parameters supplied by the user. The user can also add gifts to the database (with admin approval), track gifts viewed and identify favorites.
