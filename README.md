###Project Three

Giftr is General Assembly's WDI-ATL cohort 5's third project. Giftr is a full-stack application that was developed using Mongo, Express and Node.  The technical requirements of the assignment included:

* creating at least 2 models - one for a user and the other for the main functional idea of the app
* implementing sign up/sign in components
* using RESTful routes
* generating a database table structure with an ORM 



###GrandSlamTennis Basics

GrandSlamTennis has two functions.  The first is for the general user who, after signing up/in, can get general information about players competing in Grand Slam events.  The second is for an admin user who can update player, country and user data.  The general user does not have access to the admin user pages. 


###User Process

####General User
* Sign up/sign in
* Click on one of the tournaments (currently the Australian Open is the only one active)
* Click on draws or player name to obtain more detailed information

####Admin User
* Sign up/sign in
* Click on one of the tournaments (currently the Australian Open is the only one active)
* Click on draws or player name to obtain more detailed information
* Click on ADMIN FUNCTIONS to be directed to initial admin functions page.  From there, the admin user can Create, Update, Edit or Delete a player, country, or user.



###Language and Framework Used
