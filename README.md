###Project Three

####Team Members
Chad Christensen
Nick Touchette
Sue Rasmussen  


Giftr is General Assembly's WDI-ATL cohort 5's third project. Giftr is a full-stack application that was developed using Mongo, Express and Node.  The technical requirements of this team project included:

* Use Mongo & Express to build an API and a front-end that consumes it
* Create an API using at least 2 related models, one of which should be a user
* Include all major CRUD functions in a RESTful API for at least one of those models
* Consume your own API by making your front-end with HTML, Javascript, & jQuery
* Add authentication to your API to restrict access to appropriate users
* Craft thoughtful user stories together, as a team
* Manage team contributions and collaboration using a standard Git flow on Github
* Layout and style your front-end with clean & well-formatted CSS
* Deploy your application online so it's publically accessible
